Each line in the file includes the ids of two authors who have worked together on at least one article. In network analysis parlance, this is known as an \"edge list\". The data are obtained from the [Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html) and you can find more information about them on https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ca-GrQc.html.\n",

Your list should look like [[3466, 937], [3466, 5233], ...]. To achieve this, use a `for` loop to iterate over each line in the file. One way to do this is as follows:\n",
